                <h1>Formation and evolution</h1>
                <p>
                    The Solar System formed 4.568 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud.
                    This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds,
                    this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars.
                    As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum
                    caused it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.
                    As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200 AU and a hot,
                    dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other,
                    coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged
                    or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.

                    Due to their higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar System close to the Sun,
                    and these would eventually form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised
                    a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets
                    (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter
                    where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful
                    than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large
                    atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets
                    congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for
                    the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated
                    to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.

                    Within 50 million years, the pressure and density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough for it to begin
                    thermonuclear fusion.[49] The temperature, reaction rate, pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was achieved:
                    the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this point, the Sun became a main-sequence star.[50] The main-sequence phase,
                    from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun compared to around two billion years for all other phases
                    of the Sun's pre-remnant life combined.[51] Solar wind from the Sun created the heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas
                    and dust from the protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary formation process. The Sun is growing brighter;
                    early in its main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.

                    The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted
                    to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time,
                    the core of the Sun will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding the inert helium, and the energy output
                    will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun
                    will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler
                    (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence.[51] The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render
                    Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will be hot enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time
                    it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions
                    in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object,
                    half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth.[53] The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary
                    nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.
